# Bandit's Terrific Travel Pad
Welcome to the main repository for my open source dance pad. Currently the pad is in the alpha stage. Stay tuned here for updates.

BTTP will be a 4-panel travel size dance pad. This means that the center panel is the standard size of a DDR/ITG pad, but the steps are smaller. Many high level dance game players step only on the very inside of each step, meaning a smaller pad can be used. This makes it easier to build the pad, saves space, and makes it easer to move the pad around or ship it.

The pad will be open source, meaning all of the information on how to make one will be free. You are free to take anything I have designed for this pad, modify it, distribute it, build it yourself, and even make and sell them yourself. It would be cool if you at least link back to me or credit me in some way, but I don't really care that much. My main motivation for doing this project is that I want dance games to be easier to get into. If other people start making and selling these at a reasonable price, that would help me achieve my goal.

I am planning on making these pads and selling them myself. I will sell a fully built pad, as well as a DIY kit.

## Current Status

Currently, the pad is in alpha/prototype stages. I am working on finalizing the design into something I could start making in bulk.

## Roadmap

Now that I have a prototype built, the next step is to make the first beta.

Next, I plan to make a few betas and send them out to beta testers (will be chosen by me, bug me on Discord if you really want to be a beta tester)

Once I'm ready to ramp up to full production, I'll figure out a storefront and a way to manage orders. I also need to find bulk suppliers for all the parts.
